structure:
GitHub repository: alu-interview
Directory: rain
File: 0-rain.py

how it works:
Prototype: def rain(walls)
walls is a list of non-negative integers.
Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.
If the list is empty return 0.
